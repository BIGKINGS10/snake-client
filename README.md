# **WELCOME TO SNAKE CLIENT**

Snake game is a very popular game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and increases its length by 'eating' pieces of blocks along the way. As it moves, it eats and grows in length. Of course, the longer it gets, the more difficult it is to maneuver along its now limited paths. The goal of the game is to become as big as possible without bumping in the side walls, or bumping into itself, either of which will end the life of the snake.
